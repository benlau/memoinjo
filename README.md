# MemoInjo
Stick memo on any website and sync via Joplin

MemoInjo is a browser extension that sticks a memo on any website and edit/sync via Joplin. Simply press the icon of MemoInjo at the extension toolbar (top-right corner) in Chrome. It will show a memo editor for the browsing website. You may create a summary or a task list associated with a website easily.

MemoInjo is not a web clipper that could capture only once. You could reopen the same memo for the same URL. And thank to the sync feature of Joplin, you may access the memo across different computer.
